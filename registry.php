<p>Dear friends and family,</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s nothing we would rather have than your presence at our wedding! As such, we will not be providing a registry. If you would like to provide a gift, we would greatly appreciate your help contributing to the costs of a honeymoon. We hope to visit Newfoundland for our honeymoon!</p>
<p>Alternatively, we would encourage you to make a donation to the <a href="http://www.thedonkeysanctuary.ca/help-us">Donkey Sanctuary of Canada</a> or the <a href="http://www.guelph-humane.on.ca/donate.php">Guelph Humane Society</a> in our name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Claire and Kevin</p>
