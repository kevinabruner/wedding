    <h3>Ceremony at the <a href="http://www.thedonkeysanctuary.ca/">Donkey Sanctuary of Canada</a> (1:00 p.m.)</h3>
    <img src="/images/donks.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right" style="max-width: 350px; width:100%;margin-left:15px"/>
    <p>The Donkey Sanctuary of Canada is a refuge for donkeys, mules and hinnies from across Canada who have been neglected or abused, or who can no longer be cared for by their owners. The sanctuary is usually open one or two days a week for visitors. It is one of our favourite places in the world! </p>
	
	<p>We will be getting married inside or outside of the loft part of the barn, depending on the weather. The loft will be empty or near empty and is at ground level. Before and after the ceremony, visitors can meet the donkeys grazing nearby.</p>			
    <p>This is a working farm, so please be respectful. Some things to be aware of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will be walking a short distance on grass and dirt; please wear closed-toe shoes and do not wear high heels as the terrain is largely grass and gravel;</li>
        <li>no sitting or squatting, except in the chairs provided;</li>
        <li>no food and drinks are allowed on site (we <em>will</em> make up for it at the reception!)</li>      
    </ul>
